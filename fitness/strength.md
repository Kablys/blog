Strength, power, hypertrophi highly overlap.
# General advice
1. Focus on compund movements
2. 10-20 sets per bodypart per week with 8-15 reps each set close to failure or failure for OPTIMAL growth (35% to 75% of 1RM)
3. Dont go high volume on excercise with bad Stimulus to Fatigue Ratio (e.g. Conventionel Deadlift). Rather go high Volume on RDL or Good  Mornings and high intensity on Deadlifts
4. Use Isolations to fix lagging Body Parts AFTER your Compounds
5. Get stronger overtime
